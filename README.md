# Horiseon

This homework assignment was to refactor and simplify code for an existing website. To achieve this I replaced generic div classes with semantic html elements.  
Due to the simplicity of this layout I was able to use semantic html elements to achieve the desired affects in CSS without the use of redundant classes.  
I initially used individual commits for each of the changes I made, however gitpages would only load the readme file so you will see that there is only 1 commit- which was done to correct this issue.
